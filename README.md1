# Freelance Project Summary

This repository includes summaries of freelance front-end work I’ve completed using React.js and related technologies.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 / CSS3
- Responsive UI
- API Integration

## 📁 Projects Included
Since most projects were freelance or client-based, I’m sharing summaries instead of code:
- Real Estate UI – Login form, property cards, filtering, mobile responsive
- Ecommerce Cart – Product listing page, dynamic cart, React state handling
- Admin Dashboard – Chart components, data grids, authentication

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a React.js front-end developer with experience in freelance and contract UI projects. Actively seeking full-time roles.
